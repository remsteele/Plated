# Plated

Plated is a clean, offline-first workout logging app built with SwiftUI and SwiftData.

## Features
- Workout logging with an active session timer
- Movements with multiple variants (equipment types)
- Templates for PUSH/PULL/LEGS routines
- Workout history with PR highlights
- Profile + weekly plan overview
- Rest timer and unit preference (lb/kg)

## Tech
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData (local-only, offline-first)

## Run
Open `Plated.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build on a simulator or device.

## Notes
The database is local-only for now, but the models are structured to support future sync.
